 [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

Because it provides a lot of functionality that you wouldn't normally get by using function component (using hooks is what provides functionality when using function components). It can provide youwith extra featuressuch as ref, lifecycle, and state. It allows developers to have more flexibility when writing components.

# componentWillMount() is used in the unmounting phase when the component is removed from the screen and is used to "clean things up".

# render() is called during the mounting and  updating phase when a component's data is being being changed/updated

# shouldComponentUpdate() is used when you want to stop a component from calling render() to update the date

the components by reusing the same custom hook you built.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

It helps us to be more efficient at catching bugs, reducing regression, while acting as a safety net and documentation as we make changes
and helps us to trust the code and write better/testable code.
it can also determines whether the app can be successfully downloaded, executed and interacted with successfully.It can also help others that go in to understand your code andwhat was working before it broke.
